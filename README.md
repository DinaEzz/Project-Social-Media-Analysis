# Project-Social-Media-Analysis
The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the centrality property for each node in the graph.
There are many applications of graph theory as networks: A network consists of sites that send and receive messages of various types;
Maps and social media platforms: The relations (friendship) among users can be modeled as a graph of nodes and edges.

The project apllies three algorithms to compute centrality first Degree Centrality ,second is Closeness centrality,then Betweenness Centrality
